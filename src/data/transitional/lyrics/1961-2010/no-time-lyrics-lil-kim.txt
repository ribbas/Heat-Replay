And while you niggaz talk shit we count bank figures

Yeah, I Momma, Miss Ivana
Usually rock the Prada, sometimes Gabbana
Stick you for your cream and your riches
Zsa Zsa Gabor, Demi Moore, Prince Diane and all them rich bitches

Puff Daddy pump the Hummer for the summer
I follow in the E-Class with the goggles
96 models, Bad Click on the stroll
Tell 'em how we roll, cruise control

Nuttin' make a woman feel betta
than Berrettas and Amarettas, butta leathers and mad cheddaz
Chillin' in a Benz with my ami-gos
Tryin' to stick a nigga for his pe-sos

If you say so's, then I'm the same chick
That you wanna get with, lick up in my twat
Gotta hit the spot, if not don't test the poom poom
Nanny nanny, punanny donny, hey

How you like it baby? Uhh, from the front
Uhh, from the back, give that ass a smack
Bet your man won't do it like that
Can't work the middle, plus his thing too little

Let me grab your ta-ta's, do the cha-cha
Make you scream Pa-pa, you da best, Da Da
Now watch mama, go up and down dick to jaw crazy
Uhh! Say my name baby

Before you nut, I'ma dribble down your butt cheeks
Make you wiggle, then giggle just a little
I'm drinkin' babies, then I cracks for the Mercedes
Act shady, and feel my three-eighty

Or the raven, oohwee I see
Your girl ain't a freak like me or Adina
Huh, can't fade the rhinoceros of rap
Lil' Kim pussy how preposterous is that?

Uhh, right back at cha, the one Cleopatra
Diggin' in your stash
Niggaz think they gonna get some ass, no money, money
No licky licky, fuck the dicky dicky

And the quickie, gimme your loot, your Mac-11 then shoot
Your game ain't sweet, John Paul peeps
Shouldn't compete, if you can't wet it, forget it
Don't sweat it, I bet it'd

Make ya cum smooth if you let it
Huh, you can't stop a bitch from ballin'
Ha-ha to la-la to drive-by's they be callin
And you ain't know while you be kickin that old shit, we makin' hits

Platinum and gold shit
I stay draped in diamonds and pearls
Beside every man is a Bad Girl
That's right, nine-six Bad Boy c'mon
