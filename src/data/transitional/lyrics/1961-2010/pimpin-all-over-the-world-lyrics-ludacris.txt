Oh yeah

The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

Sing it hoes
(The world, the world, the world)

All over the world baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with ya'll
'Cause I been places you'd never imagine
But I'm gonna start at home when I see a girl I like
I walk straight up to her and I'm like
(Hey)

Unh, hey girl how ya doin?
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
And I would like to get to know you
Can you give me your name?
And if you jot down your number you'll get mine in exchange
(Hey)

See I'm the man in this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin' of me
We got people to meet and many places to see
(Hey)

Mmm, I'm really diggin' your lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
I'm kinda concerned you'll be causin' a crash
With your traffic jam booty heads pausin' so fast
(Hey)

I wouldn't trade you for the world I swear it
I like your hair in every style that you wear it
And how the colors coordinate with your clothes
From your manicured nails to your pedicured toes
(Hey)
(Whoo, oh yeah)

The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

You hear the song, so dance
Don't always think I'm tryin' to get in your pants
'Cause see me, my pimpin's in 3D
I'm takin' you places you only see on TV
(Hey)

Tryin' to show you how you livin' is trite
How many guys you know can
Bring the Travel Channel to life?
One day we on the autobahn swervin', drivin'
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
(Hey)

If you wit me ain't no time to sleep
'Specially at Wet Willy's on Miami beach but
I'll drop you off and pay you no attention
If I make to Atlanta's Bronner Brothers convention
(Hey)

Then, jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard's
Hawaii to D.C., there's plenty women to see
So if your ass don't show up it's more women for me
Hey
(Oh yeah)

The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican day parade
Then at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the Jazzfest
Then Mardi Gras, all the women
Tryin' to show me their chest
Hey

I'm in Jamaica spendin' massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to mash it up
I had sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan
(Hey)

I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois and get a taste of Chicago
(Hey)

Unh, oh yet and still
You wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
(But where the best at?)
Ain't no need in even askin' bro
The best women all reside in Africa and that's real
(Hey)
(Whoo, oh yeah)

The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars, the women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

Sing it hoes
(The world, the world, the world)
(Hey)

Pimpin', pimpin', pimpin'
Ladies and gentlemen, as we ride out
Could we have all the real pimps please
Put both your pinky fingers high in the air?

Now ladies, look around with me
Let's see if we can't
Weed some of these niggas out
'Cause it ain't no way that
All these niggas could be pimpin'

Now if happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arm
Look like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water
Please, tell that nigga, Put yo hands down

If you smell like you been at work all day
And Drakkar, please put your hands down
Now look up at the pinky fingers
That are still in the air

If you see 'em ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga washed half his hands
And lotioned three quarters of his body
Please say, Put yo hands down

If you're spinning rims spin counter clockwise
You are not pimpin'
If you are dancin' on the dance floor
And you look to your left, and your right
And there is not a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it, you are not pimpin'

If your vodka and cranberry is really, really dark
Like blood, that's because you didn't order vodka buddy
And that's why it's three dollars a glass
Oh, put your hands down

Now look down, look down now I need
I need everybody, just to pull up your pant's leg one time
Ok, you see the nigga with the white socks?
Not pimpin'!
Sorry, unless you're part of the Beat It entourage

If your shoes have a buckle on em
Not pimpin'
