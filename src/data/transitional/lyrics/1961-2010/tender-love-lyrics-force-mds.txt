Here I lay all alone, tossin', turning
Longing for some of your tender Love
I'm waiting for the right moment to come
So I can thank you for all the tender love you've given to me

Tender love, love so tender
Pulling me close to you, baby, I surrender
Candles they light the dark
Now I see how lovely the feelings are
All the tender love you've given to me

I want you more and more, can't resist you
Ooh and then I feel your touch, tender love 01.20
Loving me straight from the heart, hold me nearer
Please let me be a part of the tender love you're giving to me

Tender love, love so tender
Holding me close to you, baby, I surrender
Ooh yeah, surrender baby
