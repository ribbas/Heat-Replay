She got her own house

If you ain't on, sit down
If you ain't on, sit down
If you ain't on, sit down

I-n-d-e-p-e-n-d-e-n-t do you know what that mean?
Baby Phat just relax
Front your own flat screen
Back rub, cook, clean, man don't make her make a scene

When u call her on her cellular
She tell u she don't need not a got damn thang
You a hot damn thang
If you think u finna get her wit a got damn chain
You insane, boy you better get some goddamn change

You a fool, been to school
Even walked across the stage
And she say I love webbie
From his looks to his ways
The stilettos, the J's depend on how the weather look
Flip flop slippers just to show off the pedicure

Flip flop niggaz depend on how the cheddar look
She'll buy her own I don't think she'll never look
In a man face standin' waitin' for him to take care of her
She'll rather go to work and pay the bills on schedule

Gutta like Keisha
Work that meter
Cuz she a good freaka
Cuz she stay on her shit
She got her own shit
She don't neva trip cuz all she want is that dick

She bouncy, flossy keep them hoes off me
Gutta lil slang man, I love when she talkin'
A independent chick, do you know what that mean?
She cook, she clean, neva smell like onion rings

22's on her whip
Oh she do it large
When she break a nigga off
Got a nigga spoiled
She a bad lil' chick
A fly lil' chick
Hit me on my phone she like to buy that dick

Got her stunna shades on lookin' like sumthin'
Stallion hair long she a nice sumthin'
Like to go to the mall er'day for an outfit
Hair did, nails did, independent what she call it

She got her own house, drive her own whip
Range Rover all white, like her toe tips
She got a pretty smile, smell real good
Only time she need a man for that good jug

They buy the bar too, they superstars too
They be like you ain't got no money take yo broke tail home
In Baby Phat they on, they clothes match they phone
They be like 'yeah!' When they song come on

Leave the club kinda early 'cuz they gotta go to work
I mess wit supervisors who got credit like Big Turk
So dusty feet, please don't bother me
I got independent dimes on my mind who spoil me

Gucci hat, Gucci fit so sick
That's a gift from my independent chick yes sir!
Tryna get next to her gotta be yaself mayne
'Cause she got her own money, she don't need no help mayne
