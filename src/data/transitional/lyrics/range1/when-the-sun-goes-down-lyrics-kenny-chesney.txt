Suntanned toes ticklin' the sand
Cold drink chillin' in my right hand

Watchin' you sleep in the evenin' light
Restin' up for a long, long night

'Cuz when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down, yeah

All day long just takin' it easy
Layin' in a hammock where it's nice and breezy
And sleepin' off the night before
'Cuz when the sun goes down we'll be back for more

When the sun goes down we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

This old guitar and my dark sunglasses
This sweet concoction is smooth as molasses
Nothing to do but breathe all day
Until the big moon rises and it's time to play

When the sun goes down we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
(Sun sinks down)
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down
(When the sun goes down)

When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down, yeah

When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
She thinks cracker's sexy when the sun goes down

Umm, umm, umm
We'll be feelin' alright
When the sun sinks down over the water
Uncle Kenny's hotter when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin'
When the sun goes down, hey Uncle Kenny
When the sun goes down over the water
Everything is hotter when the sun goes down
When the sun
