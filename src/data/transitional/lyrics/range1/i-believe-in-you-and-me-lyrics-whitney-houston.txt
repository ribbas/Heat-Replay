I believe in you and me
I believe that we will be
In love eternally
Well as far as I can see
You will always be the one
For me, oh yes, you will

And I believe in dreams again
I believe that love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost, now I'm free
'Cuz I believe in you and me

I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down, baby
Then I will always be around
Just to be right where you are
My love, you know I love you, boy

I will never leave you out
I will always let you in, boy, oh baby
To places no one's ever been
Deep inside, can't you see?
That I believe in you and me

Maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
I will play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

I believe in miracles and love's the miracle
And yes, baby you're my dream come true
I was lost, now I'm free
Oh, baby 'cuz I believe, I do believe in you and me
See, I was lost, now I'm free
'Cuz I believe in you and me
Believe in you and me
