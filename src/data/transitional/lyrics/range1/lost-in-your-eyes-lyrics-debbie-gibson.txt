VERSE 1:
I get lost in your eyes
And I feel my spirits rise
And soar like the wind..
Is it love that I am in?

I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
...And now I know
'Cause when I'm lost I can't let go

CHORUS:
I don't mind not knowing what I'm headed for
You can take me to the skies...
It's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

VERSE 2:
I just fell, don't know why
Something's there we can't deny...
And when I first knew
Was when I first looked at you

And if I can't find my way
If salvation seems worlds away
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes

CHORUS:
I don't mind not knowing what I'm headed for
You can take me to the skies...
Oh it's like being lost in heaven
When I'm lost in your eyes

VERSE 3:
I get weak in a glance
Isn't this what's called romance?
Oh, I'll be found
When I am lost in your eyes
