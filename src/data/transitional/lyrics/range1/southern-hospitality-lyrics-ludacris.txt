Cadillac grills, Cadillac mill's
Check out the oil my Cadillac spills
Matter of fact, candy paint Cadillacs kill
So check out the hoes my Cadillac fills
Twenty inch, wide, twenty inches high
Hoe don't you like my twenty inch, ride
Twenty inch thighs make twenty inch, eyes
Hoping for American twenty inch, pies
Pretty ass, clothes, pretty ass, toes
Oh how I love these pretty ass, hoes
Pretty ass high class anything, goes
Catch 'em in the club throwing pretty ass 'bows
Long-john drawers, long-john stalls
Any stank puss' make my long john, pause
Women on they cell making long john calls
And if they like to juggle, get long john's, balls

All my players in the house that can buy the bar
And the balling ass niggas wit the candy cars
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes
When you get on the flow (nigga throw them 'bows)
All my women in the house if you chasing cash
And you got some big titties wit a matching ass
With ya fly-ass boots or ya open toes
When ya get on the flow (nigga throw them 'bows)

Dirty South mind blowing Dirty South bread
Catfish fried up, Dirty South fed
Sleep in a cot'-picking Dirty South bed
Dirty South girls gimme Dirty South head
Hand me down flip-flops, hand me down socks
Hand me down drug dealers hand me down rocks
Hand me down a 50 pack Swisher Sweets box
And goodfella rich niggas hand me down stocks
Mouth full of platinum, mouth full of gold
Forty glock cal' keep your mouth on hold
Lie through your teeth you could find your mouth, cold
and rip out ya tongue cause of what ya mouth, told
Sweat for the lemonade, sweat for the tea
Sweat from the hot sauce, sweat from the D
And you can sweat from a burn in the third degree
And if you sweat in your sleep then you sweat from me

All my players in the house that can buy the bar
And the balling ass niggas wit the candy cars
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes
When you get on the flow (nigga throw them 'bows)

And you got some big titties wit a matching ass
With ya fly-ass boots or ya open toes

Hit by, stars, hit by, cars
Drunk off the liquor getting hit by, bars
Keep yo' girl close cause she's hit by, far
Hit by the Neptunes, hit by guitars
Afro, picks, afro, chicks
I let my "Soul Glow" from my afro, dick
Rabbit out the hat pulling afro, tricks
Afro-American afro, thick
Overall country, overall jeans
Overall Georgia, we overall clean
"Southern Hospitality" or overall mean
Overall triple, overall beams
Thugged out niggas wear thugged out, chains
Thugged out blocks playing thugged out, games
All black tinted up thugged out, Range
DTP stay doing thugged out, thangs
