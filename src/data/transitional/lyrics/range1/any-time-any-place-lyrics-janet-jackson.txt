In the thundering rain, you stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand movin' up my thighs
Skirt around my waist, wall against my face
I can feel your lips

I don't wanna stop just because
People walkin' by are watchin' us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now

I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside, oh my love
I'm not gonna stop, no, no, no
I want you, all I wanna say is

At any time, and any place
I don't care who's around
Any time, and any place
I don't care who's around
No, no, no, no, no

Dancing on the floor, feelin' the slow groove
My mind is starting to burn with forbidden thoughts
Strangers all around with the lights down low
I was thinking maybe we could, well you know

I don't wanna stop just because
People standin' 'round are watchin' us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now

I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside of my love
I'm not gonna stop, no, no, no
I want you, all I wanna say is

Any time, and any place
I don't care who's around, n-no, no, no, no
Yeah, any time, baby, and any place
I don't care who's around
Say it again say it again

Any time, and any place
I don't care who's around
[Incomprehensible]
I don't care who's around, yeah

Any time, baby
Any place
