Oh, just a little bit dangerous

You pack your bag, you take control
You're moving into my heart and into my soul
Get out of my way, get out of my sight
I won't be walking on thin ice to get through the night

Hey, where's your work? What's your game?
I know your business but I don't know your name

Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous

You turn around, so hot and dry
You're hiding under a halo, your mouth is alive
Get out of my way, get out of my sight
I'm not attracted to go-go deeper tonight

Hey, what's your word? What's your game?
I know your business but I don't know your name

Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous
Oh, just a little bit dangerous

Hey, hey, hey, what's your word? What's your game?
I know your business but I don't know your name

Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous

She's armed, she's extremely dangerous
She's got what it takes to make ends meet
The eyes of a lover that hit like heat
You know she's a little bit dangerous
Oh, just a little bit dangerous

S'agapo
Hey, what's your word? What's your game?
I don't know your name
Hey you, just a little bit dangerous
I don't know your name
