Docta docta, need you bad
Call me babe
Docta Docta, where you at?
Give me something
I need your love

You got that kind of medicine that keeps me comin'

My body needs a hero
Come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feeling real low
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me

Make me come alive
Come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on

Come on and turn me on
Turn me on

Turn me on

Boy, I'm achin', make it right
My temperature is super high
If I scream, if I cry
It's only 'cause I feel alive

My body needs a hero
Come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feeling real low
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me

Make me come alive
Come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on

You've got my life in the palm of your hands (palm of your hands)
Come and save me now
I know you can, I know you can

Don't let me die young, I just want you to fire at my young
I just want you to be my docta, we can get it crackin' chiropractor, I, I, I, I

I know you can save me
And make me feel alive

Make me come alive
Come on and turn me on
Touch me, save my life

Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
