Here we go, come with me,
There's a world out there that we should see,
Take my hand, close your eyes
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer

Let's fly, fly, fly, fly
Up, up, here we go, go
Up, up, here we go, go
Let's fly, fly, fly, fly
Up, up, here we go, go
Where we stop nobody knows (knows)

Where we go we don't need roads (roads),
Where we stop nobody knows (knows),
To the stars if you really want it,
Got, got a jet pack with your name on it,
Above the clouds in the atmosphere (phere),
Just say the words and we outta here (outta here),
Hold my hand if you feelin' scared (scared),
We flyin' up, up outta here

Here we go, come with me,
There's a world out there that we should see,
Take my hand, close your eyes,
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer

Let's fly, fly, fly, fly
Up, up here we go, go
Up, up here we go, go
Let's fly, fly, fly, fly
Up, up here we go, go (Here we go)
Where we stop nobody knows (knows)

Baby we can stay fly like a G-6,
Shop the streets of Tokyo get your fly kicks,
Girl you always on my mind,
Got my head up in the sky,
And I'm never looking down feelin' priceless, yeah,
Where we at, only few have known
We're on some next level, Super Mario
I hope this works out, Cardio,
Til' then let's fly, Geronimo

Here we go, come with me,
There's a world out there that we should see,
Take my hand, close your eyes,
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer

Let's fly, (Yo)
Now I never been in space before,
But I ain't ever seen a face like yours
You make me feel like I could touch the planets,
You want the moon, girl watch me grab it,
Now I never seen a star this close,
You got me stuck by the way you glow,
I'm like, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm like, oh, oh, oh, oh

Here we go, come with me,
There's a world out there that we should see,
Take my hand, close your eyes,
With you right here, I'm a rocketeer

Let's fly, fly, fly, fly
Up, up here we go, go
Up, up here we go, go
Let's fly, fly, fly, fly
Up, up here we go, go
Where we stop nobody knows, knows, knows
