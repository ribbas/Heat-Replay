Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'mma start by saying this, ay
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ay
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ay
Ba-baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?

Ba-ba-baby
This is something you should know, I don't ever chase no hoes
I spotted you, you had that glow, watch me pull out all this dough
Take you where you want to go, flexing on your ex, I know
He ain't ever take you out, barely even left your house
How dare that nigga run his mouth when his pockets in a drought
The last single he put out didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ay
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ay
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ay
I got deep pockets and I swear my shit's on sink, ay
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all she sing, ay
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap in her dreams, ay
Well he mad as fuck when they sex she scream for me, ay
Big ZooWap what these niggas should be, ay

Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'mma start by saying this, ay
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ay
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ay
Ba-baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?

Baby girl, you can stay the night 'till the morn'
All this ice on my arm
What you like, what you want?
And I might put you on
Bitch, it's mine can't you see?
And I rock seventeen
All these knots in my jeans
Me and Zoo turnin' up
Got your boo in the cut
And she sue 'cause it's looking like the roof going up
Counting all this bread, I don't talk to feds
Try and take my bitch, you gonna take two to the head
'Cause baby you the baddest
All this money, I'mma cash it
And I'm swervin' all in traffic
While I'm trapping out the mansion
And I'm moving through the tri-state
Do two-hundred on the highway
And I'm swerving in my i8
Baby, you should come my way
Squad!
