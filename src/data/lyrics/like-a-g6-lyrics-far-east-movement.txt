Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink, we do it right gettin' slizzard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride (in my ride) like three six
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G 6
Like a G 6, like a G 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G 6
Like a G 6, like a G 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G 6

Gimme that Moet (et)
Gimme that Crystal (stal)
Ladies love my style, at my table gettin' wild
Get them bottles poppin', we get that drip and that drop
Now now, give me two more bottles cause you know it don't stop

(808)
Hell yea
Drink it up, drink-drink it up,
These sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
When sober girls around me they be actin'-actin' like they drunk

Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink, we do it right gettin' slizzard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride (in my ride) like three six
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G 6
Like a G 6, like a G 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G 6
Like a G 6, like a G 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G 6

Sippin' on, sippin' on sizz, I'm a ma, make it fizz
Girl i keep it gangsta, poppin' bottles at the crib
This is how we live, every single night
Take that bottle to the head, and let me see you fly

(808)
Hell Yea
Drink it up, drink-drink it up,
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
When sober girls around me actin-actin like they drunk

Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink, we do it right gettin' slizzard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride (in my ride) like three six
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G 6
Like a G 6, like a G 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G 6
Like a G 6, like a G 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G 6
